I have been looking for a easy integration programable diagram solution for a while and I think this is it. The sytax is very simple and it integrates with nearly everything or can run stand alone. Also the default output is SVG. 

The mermaid files ".mmd" can be viewed through github without uploading the SVGs which is also nice. I will keep playing around with this tool as I think it would be a great addition for some diagrams.
