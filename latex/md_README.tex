\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{Building}\label{md_README_autotoc_md3}
For development the build type should be set to {\itshape Debug}, but all performance testing should use {\itshape Release}. There may be issues when trying to compile multiple build types so the build folder should have a different name. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd doe-\/egot-\/system}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/S . -\/B build -\/DCMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE=Debug -\/DCMAKE\_EXPORT\_COMPILE\_COMMANDS=1}

If you would like to build the documentation install the following requirments and run doxygen. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo apt install doxygen graphviz}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd docs}
\DoxyCodeLine{doxygen}

\end{DoxyCode}


If you would like a PDF of the documentation run install the following requirments and run make within the latex folder. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo apt install texlive-\/base texlive-\/latex-\/recommended texlive-\/latex-\/extra}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd docs}

\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{Running}\label{md_README_autotoc_md5}
Running the system as a whole is done through the {\itshape run\+\_\+egot.\+sh} script found in tools. It will spawn tree tmux sessions\+: GSP, DTMC, and DERS. The DERS session will have {\itshape n} number of DCMS running in individual windows within the session. See snapshot of terminal after running.

Stopping the EGoT system only requires stopping all tmux sessions.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The entity component system modules for IEEE 2030.\+5 Common, Support, and Smart Energy resources has be created and primary components have be registered.
\item The next step will include the addition of specific systems for each resource as needed.

\item \href{https://github.com/PortlandStatePowerLab/doe-egot-system/tree/temp-system-updates/interfaces}{\texttt{ interfaces}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The https client and server have been implemented using the Singleton design pattern to make the GSP and DCM implementation easier.
\item The https server now uses the ECS as its backend for resource storage and processing. Currently only the Device Capability resource has been tested, but the remaining resources will be added as we progress through the Test Plan.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item There have been a few updates to the models to bring them more inline with the IEEE standard representation. Most notably all Link and List\+Link member variables have been changed.
\item The edits where updated with the xml adapter class and further tests will be written as the Test Plans are develeped.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Stubs have been made for each of the main EGoT components and a Unit Test will be written for each Product Requirment.
\item Currently supporting test outputs have been stored in text files. The XML tests and Https Test using the new ECS as a backend for the server are stored within this folder.
